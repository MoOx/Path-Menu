# CSS Path Menu

Quick recreation of the path flyout menu built with CSS/HTML (no javascript).
This has not been thoroughly browser tested and was built just for fun.

I use Sass & Compass to generate the CSS, so it's extensible.

##### Notes

_I remove the javascript form the project I fork, & review the code & the design to be exactly the same as the Path Menu (checkout original-source folder)_
